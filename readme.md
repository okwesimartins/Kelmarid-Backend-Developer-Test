#  Kelmarid Backend Engineer Challenge

  

The goal of this challenge if to create an AdonisJsAPI backend matching the objectives down below.

  

To bootstrap this project, we've used a basic [AdonisJs](https://docs.adonisjs.com/guides/introduction) template. There is a Dockerfile available in case you want to work with Docker during development, but this is not a requirement.

  

The usage of the following packages is mandatory:

- AdonisJs 
- @adonisjs/lucid
- Typescript
- Testing

To store your data you can either use a sqllite database file, or use a local Postgres database (preferred).

  

If you choose to use a Postgres database, please provide a seed-file with some dummy data and a migration file to setup the database schema.

  

In case you use sqllite, provide the database file.

  

## Objectives

  

Create a username/password protected API that authenticates API requests using Bearer tokens (not session tokens). Store the user credentials in your database and allow us to sign in using the a frontend/API call (please provide the credentials for one user, no need to create functionality to create users). All routes are to be protected.
